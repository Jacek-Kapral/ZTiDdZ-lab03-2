Second excercise from lab no. 3 in Identity and Access Management course

Script that in first version uses generation of mix ascii characters, with obligatory usage of lowercase and uppercase letters,
digits and special characters, with added suffling at the end so it would be more random. Generates 8 character strings. 
Not really a safe password, to be honest.

In second version i've added min and max length between 8 and 128 characters, and a function that chooses a random number of characters
in that range and generates a password. Now i'm sure passwords generated are pretty safe.
